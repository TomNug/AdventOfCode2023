# AdventOfCode2023
My repository for my solutions for 2023's Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). It is an advent calendar of programming problems. Problem descriptions have been copied into READMEs for convenience. They are not mind and belong to Advent of Code.

# What I have learned
## Day 1 - Parsing strings for values of numeric words and characters
Learning how to implement **regex** in C#.

## Day 2 - Parsing strings for values of the number of coloured cubes drawn
Further practise with **regex**. Using **xUnit** to implement tests for Day 1. Used **xUnit** as part of development for Day 2, testing each element as it was made before proceeding.

## Day 3 - Parsing a grid of characters to identify larger numbers within and proximity to specific symbols
**Test-driven development** where tests are created before the implementation helped my understanding of the problem and each stage. Used **MemberData** in **xUnit** to allow for more complext test data.

## Day 4 - Parsing strings to identify sets of numbers and performing calculations based on the intersections
More **test-driven development** helped with the process. Made progress in secure increments and was confident in my code. More complex **regex** patterns, so more good practise. Using **sets** and **intersections** to find crossover between numbers.

## Day 5 - Parsing strings to identify sets of numbers which define arithmetic functions applied to specific ranges of numbers. Processing numbers through these functions.
**Testing** is such a stress relief. Instead of processing each number in a large range, can instead work with the limits of the range instead. More practice with **regex**.

## Day 6 - Using the quadratic equation to spare brute force
**Unit tests** narrowed the problem when debugged, making development easier. More regex.

## Day 7 - Parsing card hands and ranking them
**Test-driven development** making development calmer, and easier to debug. More **regex**. Implementing **IComparable** with custom **CompareTo**.

## Day 8 - Parsing series of crossroads with left and right turn options that lead to further crossroads, finding steps from start point to destination
**Regex**, **Dictionaries**, **Prime factorization**, **Lowest Common Multiples**. If the only option is a bruteforce which is taking too long, assumptions need updating.

## Day 9 - Extrapolating sequences to identify subsequent and preceeding numbers
**Regex**, **stacks**.

## Day 10 - Determinining connectivity of nodes on a grid based on their symbols, traversing the grid to find loops of symbols, and unreachable elements.
**Flood-fill algorithm**, **queues**, **2D arrays**, **breadth-first search**.
