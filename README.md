# AdventOfCode2023
My repository for my solutions for 2023's Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). It is an advent calendar of programming problems. 

# What I have learned
## Day 1 - Parsing strings for values of numeric words and characters
Learning how to implement **regex** in C#.

## Day 2 - Parsing strings for values of the number of coloured cubes drawn
Further practise with **regex**. Using **xUnit** to implement tests for Day 1. Used **xUnit** as part of development for Day 2, testing each element as it was made before proceeding.

## Day 3 - Parsing a grid of characters to identify larger numbers within and proximity to specific symbols
**Test-driven development** where tests are created before the implementation helped my understanding of the problem and each stage. Used **MemberData** in **xUnit** to allow for more complext test data.

## Day 4 - Parsing strings to identify sets of numbers and performing calculations based on the intersections
More **test-driven development** helped with the process. Made progress in secure increments and was confident in my code. More complex **regex** patterns, so more good practise. Using **sets** and **intersections** to find crossover between numbers.
